## General

  * Rxjava is a java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions
  * Reactive Extensions is library for composing asynchronus, event-based programs by using observables
  * If your sure about the task you know the time taken e.g like image processing use computation 
  and if your unsure about the task like network call, file move or copy, db operaion use io schedulers
  * RxAndroid extends RxJava to provide main thread schedulers, loopers, handlers to Rxjava as it is a library thats how we get 
   `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()`
