## This page is for general tips which I have come across or read through

* To get unique Device ID when you using telephony manager will be suitable only for smartphones as tablets do not have telephony services 
* Devices without telephony services like tablets must report a unique device ID that is available via android.os.Build.SERIAL
* We can get Android Id unique and constant throughout device lifecycle both for smartphones and tablets, 
  Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID itâ€™s a 64-bit number. 
* `String androidId = Settings.Secure.getString(getContentResolver(),
                     Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);`
* However, the value may change if a factory reset is performed on the device.
* Using UUID is best solution as it is unique for a installation, using this we can identify a user even if he changes different devices.
