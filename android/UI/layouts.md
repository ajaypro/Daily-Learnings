* ~16 milliseconds to render a single frame to avoid any janky behaviour in the app
* app processes an object for layout, the app performs the same process on all children of the layout the framework executes the layout or 
  measure stage in a single pass and quite quickly.
* complicated layouts may have to iterate multiple times on parts of the hierarchy that require multiple passes to resolve before ultimately positioning 
  the elements.
* Having to perform more than one layout-and-measure iteration is referred to as DOUBLE TAXATION
  * A LinearLayout with layout_weight needs each child to be measured twice.
  * GridLayout with weights or fill gravity makes it lose all the pre-processing benefits.
  * RelativeLayout always takes at least 2 passes

* Systrace
* GPU overdraw - show overdraw areas in layout using mobile 

Android drawing views
---------------------
* Measure - Performs a top down traversal approach measures the views and its viewgroup size 
* Layout - Performs a top down traversal approach to position the views in layout
* Draw - Performs a top down traversal approach, creates a canvas object for each view object and sends a list of commands to GPU which includes viewgroup
  and views size and positions. 
* Each phase within the drawing process requires a top-down traversal of the view tree. Therefore, the more views you embed within each other (or nest) into the view hierarchy, the more time and computation power it takes for the device to draw the views
* The CPU takes the high-level object(button, textView, etcâ€¦) and turns it into a display list. 
* GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a hardware piece that takes these high-level objects through OpenGL-ES API and turns it into pixels in a texture or on the screen.

Grid Layout
-----------
* `GridLayout` arranges items in a grid of rows and columns. Assuming vertical scrolling, by default, each item in a row takes up one "span." 
  (In this case, one span is equivalent to the width of one column.)
  
Relative Layout
---------------
* draws child views relative to one another by using relative layout params. 
* draws double container to position child views next to one another to measure and finalize the position and rendering
  * first layout containerpass check the views and their sizes to be postioned, 
  * second layout container pass relative layout uses to reposition and make boundary adjustments to place the views 
  * These two keeps happening for every change in relative layout.
  
Linear Layout
-------------

* Default orientation is horizontal and places child views based on layout_weight attribute which is performance heavy
* Also behaves double layout behaviour when there a measureWithLargeChild  attribute used
