* If you want to check anything which returns with execption if null requireNotNull(value)
 
```
 fun main() {
   val fish = Fish("salmon")
    val fish1 = Fish("salmon")
   var a = 12 
   var b = 12
   // numbers, characters, boolean represent as classes at runtime so
   // referential equialty would behave the same as equals sign
   
   println(fish === fish1) 
   //println(fish)
}
```
