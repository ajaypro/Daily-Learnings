* Today I was given a task I started working but was stuck at first step because and
  was rushing to implement the solution asap but it was taking more time

### Lessons Learnt
##### Mistakes
* I was thinking in generic terms of android and looking for solutions to solve
##### Improvement
* Should have thought on exiting projectthe problems in which i wasted 1 day which was much simpler implementation
##### Mistakes       
* Was not getting expected output 
##### Improvement
* Failed to simply focus on simple logic, this due to simple thinking and imagination of different perspective.
