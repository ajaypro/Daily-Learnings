* Today I was given a task I started working but was stuck at first step because and
  was rushing to implement the solution asap but it was taking more time

### Lessons Learnt


| Mistakes | Improvement |
|----------|-------------|
|I was thinking in generic terms of android| Should have thought on exiting project|
 and looking for solutions to solve          which was much simpler implementation
 the problems in which i wasted 1 day       
|Was not getting expected output | Failed to simply focus on simple logic, this
                                   due to simple thinking and imagination of 
                                   different perspective.
