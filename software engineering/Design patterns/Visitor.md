## Visitor Pattern

* Applies same process to unrelated objects so the client does not worry about the processing of the result. client only gets the response 
  from this pattern and all the hard work is been done by this pattern. e.g cashier in supermarket weighs different products 
   and completes billing for different items and customer gets only the bill
